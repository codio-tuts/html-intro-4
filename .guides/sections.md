#'Forking' this module
If you check the url address bar of your browser, if it starts with `https://codio.com/anon/....` then this means it is an anonymous project and any changes you make will be lost when you close down the browser tab. This will be the case if you access the module from the Codio Courses screen.

To avoid losing changes, you can 'fork' the module into your own Codio account where it will appear in your projects list. To do this, select the **'Project->Fork'** menu item and choose a suitable name for the project.

#A few words about the Codio Guide
Before we start with this module here are a few pointers about using this Codio Guide.

If you've already read this in another Guide then skip to the next section.

![](.guides/img/guides-helper.jpg)

#The File Tree
The left most panel is the File Tree **(1)**. This is where your project's files are stored. You can open up files you see listed there by clicking on them.

#About the Codio Guide
The Codio Guide **(2)** is the content you are reading right now. It's worth knowing the following

- if you ever close the Guide tab by mistake, simply open in from the View menu **(3)**.
- you can expand and collapse the Guide's Table of Contents **(4)** with the Hamburger icon **(5)**
- you move from one section of the Guide to the next using either the Table of Contents or the Navigation Buttons (6)

#The Rocket Menu
The Rocket menu **(7)** is a dropdown menu that lets you load code into your file tree when you click it as different sections might want to show different bits of code.

You are usually encouraged to mess around with the live code. It is perfectly likely that you can wreck the code so pressing the Rocket menu button will restore the code again to its original state.

#Previewing
The Preview button **(8)** lets you run your web application. When you press it, it will open up a preview window so you can play with your app.

#Code Tabs
When you open some code from the file tree or the Codio Guide opens a file for you automatically, they will appear within a tab **(9)** in one of the panels. You can have several of these open at one time so you may need to click on the respective tab to get to see the file you want.

This module is a whole series of challenges that assess your knowledge of HTML and, primarily, CSS. 

Challenges are broken down into Easy, Medium, Moderate and Brutal. When you select a challenge, the following happens :

- a couple of files will be copied into the root of your workspace file tree
- you should open `challenge.md` which describes the challenge in details and will often show a video
- you will be provided with a skeleton `index.html` file for each test
- you will be writing your CSS inside `index.html` and skeleton will be there

Once you are finished with a test, you can save the status of your test by selecting 'Save' from the ![](.guides/img/rocket.png) Rocket menu item. If you load another challenge without saving, you will lose your work.

##Approach
You can use these tests not just to assess yourself but also to learn. As we have been pointing out in previous modules, coding involves an awful lot of Googling for stuff you don't know. 

##Purpose
The purpose of this set of tests is not to test you on absolutely everything. If you can complete all of the tests below, right through to brutal, then it will be safe to assume that you know enough to be seriously impressive.

However, you should really make sure that you can do the easy and moderate tests. The hard and brutal ones can be conquered over time.
