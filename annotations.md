#ASSESS & STRETCH

This module is a whole series of challenges that assess your knowledge of HTML and, primarily, CSS. 

Challenges are broken down into Easy, Medium, Moderate and Brutal. When you select a challenge, the following happens :

- a couple of files will be copied into the root of your workspace file tree
- you should open `challenge.md` which describes the challenge in details and will often show a video
- you will be provided with a skeleton `index.html` file for each test
- you will be writing your CSS inside `index.html` and skeleton will be there

Once you are finished with a test, you can save the status of your test by selecting 'Save' from the Rocket menu item. If you load another challenge without saving, you will lose your work.

##Approach
You can use these tests not just to assess yourself but also to learn. As we have been pointing out in previous modules, coding involves an awful lot of Googling for stuff you don't know. 

##Purpose
The purpose of this set of tests is not to test you on absolutely everything. If you can complete all of the tests below, right through to brutal, then it will be safe to assume that you know a lot more besides. 

However, you should really make sure that you can do the easy and moderate tests. The hard and brutal ones can be conquered over time.

##Easy Challenges

1. [Colors I]() - this is really easy and is here to help you get the hang of the challenge machanism.
1. [Common HTML stuff]() - this just makes sure that you know the common HTML tags and how to style them.
1. [Common HTML stuff II]() - more of the same but a tad more advanced tags.
1. [Proper Colors II]() - this one is more serious and tests your knowledge of the different color value systems.
1. [Gradients]() - let's see how well you can set up a few color gradients using CSS.
1. [Simple list styling]() - a couple of different ways to style a list.
1. [Padding]() - visually styling some HTML elements using padding.
1. [Margins]() - visually styling some HTML elements using margins.
1. [Borders]() - putting borders on things.
1. [Fixed Width]() - make a fixed width design that is centered on the page.


##Moderate Challenges
1. [2 Columns, fixed width]() - designing a 2 column layout that is page centered.
1. [2 Columns, variable width]() - a 2 column layout with columns expanding to almost fill the page.
1. [What's wrong here?]() - we've got a layout issue that is not quite working. Sort it out!
1. [Make the whole div a link]() - we have got a <div> with an image and some text with a link on it. Make the entire <div> clickable.


##Hard Challenges
1. [CSS Button that is fully clickable]() - create a CSS based button where the entire button is clickable, not just the text.
