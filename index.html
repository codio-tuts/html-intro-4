  <h1>HTML &amp; CSS Challenge Suite</h1>
  <p>Work your way through the tests and see how you get on. </p>
  <p>The purpose of this set of tests is not to test you on absolutely everything. If you can complete all of the tests below, right through to brutal, then it will be safe to assume that you know enough to be seriously impressive.</p>

  <p>However, you should really make sure that you can do the easy and moderate tests. The hard and brutal ones can be conquered over time.</p>
  
  <h2>Easy</h2>
  <p>The following tests should not present much of a challenge. If you struggle then you should probably  revisit the first two course modules.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Colors I</h3>
      <p>This is really easy and is here to help you get the hang of the challenge mechanism. <a href="/easy/01-colors/index.html">Open Project</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Common HTML stuff</h3>
      <p>Makes sure that you know a few common HTML tags and how to style them</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Common HTML stuff II</h3>
      <p>More of the same but a tad more advanced tags.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
